## Project Overview

This project aims to study the creation of tokens on the Ethereum blockchain and the transaction between the simulation users.We will use the Ethereum test network for experiments to understand how smart contracts and tokens operate on the blockchain.By simulating transactions, we can understand the basic concepts of the cryptocurrency market and decentralized finance (DEFI).



## Project Objectives

Create a custom token: deploy a smart contract on the Ethereum test network to create a custom token.

Simulation user: Create a set of simulated user accounts for the execution of token transactions.

Perform token transactions: The tokens trading between the simulation users to understand how smart contracts handle transactions and balances.

Data analysis: Collect and analyze simulation transaction data to evaluate token prices, liquidity and user behavior.

Documents and reports: Write project reports, summarize research results and obtained insights.

## Project method

Token creation: Use solidity to write smart contracts to create custom token, define supply, symbols and names.

User simulation: Multi -user accounts are simulated through private keys and wallets for execution of token transactions.

Token transactions: Writing smart contracts to simulates tokens trading between users, including purchases and sales.

Data collection: Use the Ethereum block browser and custom script to collect simulated transaction data.

Data analysis: Through data analysis tools, toasting token price fluctuations, user transaction volume and smart contract execution.

## Project Plan:

Week 1-2: Study the basic knowledge of Ethereum, Solidity and smart contracts.

Week 3-4: Write tokens to create smart contracts and deploy to the Ethereum test network.

Week 5-6: Create an analog user account and write token transaction smart contracts.

Week 7-8: The token transactions between the simulation users and the data collection is started.

Week 9-10: Analyze data, write project reports, and summarize the results of the research.
